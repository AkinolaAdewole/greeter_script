Hoisting Recap
What Youâ€™ve Learned So Far:
JavaScript hoists function declarations and variables declared with var to the top of the current scope.
Hoisting doesn't happen when variables are declared with let or const.
Variable assignments are not hoisted so function expressions are not hoisted.
Best Practices
Declare functions and variables at the top of your scripts, 
so the syntax and behavior are consistent with each other.
Use let and const to declare variables. You may see var in 
legacy code, but do not use it in any new code you are writing.
