Objects are Powerful!
Objects allow us to wrap up pieces of related data and functionality into one single container.

Arrays are a special type of object in JavaScript with methods including length() , 
reverse() , sort() , push(), and pop() -- but objects are much more than arrays. JavaScript includes a lot of other built-in objects.

In this lesson, we'll learn all about how we can create our own objects that contain both data and 
functions that we can use to manipulate or operate on that data. By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Create a JavaScript object
Use dot notation and bracket notation to access object elements
Use typeof to access the type of a variable
Add and access methods in JavaScript objects
Use JavaScript naming conventions for property names
